Speech Command Recognition in MATLAB (Bark-Spectrogram CNN)

Name: zixian jia
Sid: 530315863



Research Question： 
On clean Speech Commands, can a compact CNN trained on Bark spectrograms reach near-baseline accuracy while staying lightweight.

We will also test a tiny variant to study the accuracy–size trade-off.


Methodology：
MATLAB Online: Google Speech Commands. 
Bark spectrogram baseline, optional Mel. 
CNN per MathWorks example + tiny CNN. Speaker-stratified split.
minimal augmentation.


Evaluation： Accuracy, Macro-F1, Confusion Matrix. 
model Params and CPU latency.  
Planned figures. confusion matrix, accuracy-vs-model-size, learning curves.
